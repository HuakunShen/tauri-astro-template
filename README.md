# tauri-astro-template

This is a template for a Tauri application that uses the [astro](https://astro.build) static site generator.

## Branches

- `main`: the main branch contains a completely empty Astro project + Tauri v1 with zero setup
- `v2`: you can find the the tauri-astro template with Tauri v2 (currently in beta)
- `shadcn-vue`: you can find the the tauri-astro template with TailwindCSS + Vue.js + shadcn-vue
- `v2-shadcn-vue`: Tauri v2 (beta) + astro + TailwindCSS + Vue.js + shadcn-vue

If you want to use react with shadcn, you can add react and shadcn for react. I didn't make another branch for that.
