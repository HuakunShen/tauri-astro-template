# tauri-astro-template

This is a template for a Tauri application that uses the [astro](https://astro.build) static site generator.

The main branch contains a completely empty Astro project with zero setup.

On `shadcn-vue` branch, you can find the the tauri-astro template with TailwindCSS + Vue.js + shadcn-vue.

If you want to use react with shadcn, you can add react and shadcn for react. I didn't make another branch for that.
